To get the code from the course repository
(https://github.com/ajsierakowski/530-390-13)
into your own account that you can commit to:
- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Visit https://github.com/ajsierakowski/530-390-13 and click `Fork' in the
  upper right-hand corner. This makes your own copy of the course repository
  that you can work on.
- Copy the URL to your repository (it should look similar to the course
  repository, but with your username). I recommend using the HTTPS protocol to
  simplify the authentication process.
- On Merlin, in a directory in which you want the course repository to reside,
  type `git clone <URL to your repository>'.
- You should now have the directory `530-390-13', and it contains the contents
  of the course repository.

If you make changes and would like to save the state of your code:
- Use `git add <files>' to add the files that you want to include in the commit.
  You can find a summary of the files you've edited using `git status'.
- Now type `git commit -m "Describe your changes here"'.
- Finally, use `git push' to send the commit to GitHub.
- You should now be able to view your changes on your GitHub webpage.

**untested**
When I make changes to the course repository (if you and I have conflicting
changes, this becomes slightly more involved):
First time only: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ajsierakowski/530-390-13.git'
- Pull changes to course repo: `git pull upstream master'
